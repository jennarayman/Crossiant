    <h1>Jenna Rayman</h1>
    <p>I am an experienced museum professional with a diverse skill set ranging from traditional academic research and writing to more unconventional talents such as digital illustration, user experience design, and web development. My work focuses on synthesizing these skills in order to design and produce interactive digital products and experiences for a variety of cultural institutions. Currently, my research interests include collective memory, collective trauma, and the history of conspiracy theories in the United States. In my free time, you can find me listening to true crime podcasts, trying out new recipes, or cuddling with my cats, Scully and Fox.</p>
